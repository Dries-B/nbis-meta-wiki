# Getting started

To start using the workflow either clone the repo and install the conda environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NBISweden/nbis-meta.git
cd nbis-meta
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
or pull the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker pull nbisweden/nbis-meta
```

You are now ready to start using the workflow with some example data. Check out some common [examples](https://github.com/NBISweden/nbis-meta/wiki/Examples) and see [how to create a sample list](https://github.com/NBISweden/nbis-meta/wiki/Defining-your-samples-in-the-sample-list) to start working with your own data.
